# Round Counting Fix - Preventing 600+ Rounds Issue

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The original round counting system had a critical flaw that caused 600+ rounds to be counted:

### **Root Causes:**
1. **30° threshold too wide**: Considered "near Hajar al-Aswad" for 60° of movement (330° to 30°)
2. **Multiple passes per round**: Could trigger multiple passes during a single rotation
3. **No rotation requirement**: Didn't require actual movement around the Kaaba
4. **No cooldown**: Could immediately trigger another pass after leaving the zone

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### **New Round Counting System:**

#### **1. Smaller Threshold (5° instead of 30°)**
```csharp
public float hajarAswadThreshold = 5f; // Much more precise detection
```
- **Before**: 30° threshold = 60° wide detection zone
- **After**: 5° threshold = 10° wide detection zone
- **Result**: Much more precise corner detection

#### **2. Rotation-Based Round Completion**
```csharp
public float roundCompletionThreshold = 350f; // Require 350° of movement
public bool requireFullRotation = true;
```
- **Requires actual movement**: Must rotate 350° around Kaaba
- **Prevents false counts**: No round completion without movement
- **Authentic Tawaf**: Matches real Tawaf requirements

#### **3. Round Progress Tracking**
```csharp
private float roundStartAngle = 0f;
private float totalRotationThisRound = 0f;
private bool roundInProgress = false;
```
- **Tracks rotation**: Measures actual degrees moved
- **Round state management**: Prevents multiple round starts
- **Progress monitoring**: Shows completion percentage

## 📊 How It Works Now

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Pass Hajar al-Aswad** (within 5° of 0°)
   - Sets `hajarAswadPasses = 1`
   - Starts round tracking

2. **Track Rotation**
   - Measures angle changes during movement
   - Accumulates `totalRotationThisRound`
   - Only counts significant movements (>1°)

3. **Complete Round**
   - Requires 350° of rotation
   - Increments `currentRound`
   - Resets for next round

4. **Reset for Next Round**
   - Clears `hajarAswadPasses`
   - Resets `totalRotationThisRound`
   - Allows new round to start

### **UI Improvements:**

- **Round Progress**: Shows `350° / 350°` completion
- **Precise Threshold**: Shows `5°` threshold in UI
- **Real-time Feedback**: Updates as you move

## 🎯 Expected Results

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ 600+ rounds counted
- ❌ Multiple passes per rotation
- ❌ No movement requirement
- ❌ Wide detection zone

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ 1 round per complete circle
- ✅ Precise corner detection
- ✅ Movement requirement
- ✅ Authentic Tawaf counting

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### **Adjustable Parameters:**
```csharp
public float hajarAswadThreshold = 5f;        // Corner detection precision
public float roundCompletionThreshold = 350f; // Required rotation for round
public bool requireFullRotation = true;       // Enforce movement requirement
```

### **Fine-tuning:**
- **Increase threshold** (5° → 10°) for easier detection
- **Decrease threshold** (5° → 3°) for more precision
- **Adjust completion** (350° → 360°) for stricter rounds

## 📱 Testing Instructions

1. **Walk around Kaaba** in complete circles
2. **Watch round progress** in UI
3. **Verify 1 round per circle**
4. **Check corner detection** at Hajar al-Aswad
5. **Confirm 7 rounds maximum** for Tawaf

## 🎉 Success Indicators

✅ **Round count stays reasonable** (1-7 rounds)  
✅ **Progress bar fills up** as you rotate  
✅ **Precise corner detection** at Hajar al-Aswad  
✅ **Authentic Tawaf experience** with real movement  
✅ **No more 600+ round issues**  

The round counting is now fixed and should provide an authentic Tawaf experience! 🕌📱✨
